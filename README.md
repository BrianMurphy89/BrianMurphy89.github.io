# Higher-Lower
How to Play:
1. The dealer (computer) will random select a card from the deck of 52 cards.
2. Player One will guess what that card is. If they are correct, it will become Player Two's turn.
3. If Player One's first guess is wrong, the dealer will inform you if the card is actually higher or lower than your guess.
4. Player One will guess one more time based on the dealer's response. If you are correct, it becomes Player Two's turn.
5. If you are wrong, you will drink your beverage for the difference between your second guess and the card! It will then become Player Two's turn.
6. Player Two will repeat this process until it is Player One's turn.
7. The turns will go back and forth until the 52 cards are gone in the deck.
8. The winner of the game will be whoever has a LOWER overall score. (Although, some may think it is the other way around).
